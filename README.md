A project to be used as reference for a refresher course in
creating a application with a single frament hosting a 
RecyclerView.

Create a application that shows 100 chores (title and DIY indicator)
in a recycler view. Make the chore view item clickable and 
process the click in the fragment (interface implemented by
fragment and passed to viewhandler and on to viewholder)
